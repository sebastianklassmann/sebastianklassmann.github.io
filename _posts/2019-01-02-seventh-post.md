### Finding your own projects


**Dear students,**

First of all: Happy New Year 2019!  
  
I hope that you all had a tremendous start of the year and wish you all the very best for what is to come this year.  
  
We have a couple of sessions remaining in our winter term course in which we will deal with some remaining chapters from the music21 documentation.  
However, another main focus will be to gain some perspective for what kind of scientific questions in computational and cognitive musicology can be tackled using Python, Jupyter and algorithmic thinking.  
  
I have uploaded a fourth assignment to our master branch. This one is not obligatory, but it might help you in developing more practical experience with programming in Python and music21.  
  
Additionally, there is a number of good resources for articles that you might want to check out in order to see what is possible:  
  
[Music Genre classification in Spotify](https://towardsdatascience.com/music-genre-classification-with-python-c714d032f0d8)  
[Introduction to NumPy](https://towardsdatascience.com/numpy-guide-for-people-in-a-hurry-22232699259f)  
[Probabilistic Transition Tables vs. Deep Learning in Music Generation](https://towardsdatascience.com/making-music-when-simple-probabilities-outperform-deep-learning-75f4ee1b8e69)  
[The corresponding video for the above article:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeU5xzsqPmk&t=13s)  
[music21's own blog](https://music21-mit.blogspot.com/2016/07/using-music21-for-jazz-improv-and-study.html)  
  
All these ideas and articles are just examples. A main skill in computational/algorithmic thinking is exploration. Thus, feel free to find your own scientific or everyday problems that you think can be tackled using what we have studied in our course.  
  
I will see you all next week!
