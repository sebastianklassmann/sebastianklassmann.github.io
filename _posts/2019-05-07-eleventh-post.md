# Music21 - Let's start!  
  
Dear students,  
  
We have been getting a head start on working with music21 over the course of last week.  
Today's blog post is just to point you at two resources that might be of interest to you regarding the enterprise of our seminar:  
  
* First, [here's](https://pushpullfork.com/computational-musicology/) a blog post by Kris Shaffer on what he defines as *Computational Musicology*.
* Second, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWnyMNmlLo) an interview with the creator of music21 that might show you a little more about this gem of a software library.  
  
Have a lovely week, everybody!
