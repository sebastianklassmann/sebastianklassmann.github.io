title: Off to a good start!

## To all students:  Welcome aboard! <br><br>
  
  
The start of our seminar is steadily approaching.  
Please feel free to browse this wesite, I already added a couple of useful links regarding  
our Monday course that you can browse at your own leisure.

For now, I would just like to point you to [Github](http://github.com) and ask you to  
set up your free GitHub account there. We will not be using GitHub and version control  
via Git during the first weeks of our class, but it is a good idea to get the infrastructure  
out of the way.  
Don't worry: this will be an introductory class, *just as I promised.*
  
**Please note:** Make sure you register with a username and password combination that  
you can remember and that you are comfortable using within the University context.  
I suggest that you either use your real name or the shorthand that correlates to your  
sMail-Account. We will need to identify you by your GitHub user name.

We will be using GitHub at a later point in this course to introduce assignments and  
version control to our collaborative coding.  

For now, please have a nice week and see you all next **Monday (8th), at 12:00 sharp**.
