## Use GitHub! <br><br>
  
  
The start of our seminar is steadily approaching.  
For now, I would just like to point you to [Github](http://github.com) and ask you to  
set up your free GitHub account there.  

We will be using GitHub at a later point in this course to introduce assignments and  
version control to our collaborative coding.  

For now, please have a nice week and see you all next Monday (8th), at 12:00 sharp.
