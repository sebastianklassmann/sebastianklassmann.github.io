## To all students: we will use GitHub! <br><br>
  
  
The start of our seminar is steadily approaching.  
Please feel free to browse this site, I already added a couple of useful links regarding  
our Monday course that you can browse at your own leisure.

For now, I would just like to point you to [Github](http://github.com) and ask you to  
set up your free GitHub account there. 
  
**Please note:** Make sure you register with a username and password combination that  
you can remember and that you are comfortable using within the University context.  
I suggest that you either use your real name or the shorthand that correlates to your  
sMail-Account. We will need to identify you by your GitHub user name.

We will be using GitHub at a later point in this course to introduce assignments and  
version control to our collaborative coding.  

For now, please have a nice week and see you all next Monday (8th), at 12:00 sharp.
