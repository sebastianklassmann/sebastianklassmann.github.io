title: Introduction to Python
---

#### Dear students,
thank you all for two very nice first sessions in this course.  
  
Today, we will be diving right into programming in Python 3.6.  
Our introduction will have a very much hands-on approach.  
You can update your course materials folder on our JupyterHub via the link below.  

You will receive additional instructions on how to handle the new notebook during our session in class  
today. 

**If you can't make it, here's what you need to do:**  
  
* after hitting the link below, navigate to the IntroductionToPython folder.
* right-click on the notebook in it.
* "Duplicate" the notebook.
* select the duplicate and drag it to the "home" icon in the folder toolbar.
* You are now ready to make changes in the notebook without affecting the online materials.
