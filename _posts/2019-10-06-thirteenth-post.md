### Welcome to the GitHub page for our courses on Computational Musicology (winter term 2019)! ###

I am glad that you found this site. It will be updated in due time to contain
useful bits of information, reading material and presentations dealt with in our
course.

For now, feel free to browse older posts from last semester, as well as the
pages referenced in the "resources" section.

One more important thing: please head over to [https://github.com](GitHub) and  create a free account. Please write down your login credentials and pick a user name that can be identified.

In our course, GitHub will serve as a way to hand out course materials. We will be using GitHub classroom to deal out and hand in assignments. Don't worry, we will be going over all the basics you need in our course.

See you all next Tuesday and please remember to bring an internet-capable device(i.e., a laptop or tablet computer!)
