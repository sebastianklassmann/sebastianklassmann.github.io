title: Git, GitHub, GitHub classroom?

#### Dear students,

tomorrow we will be focussing on a specific walkflow for sharing project files among collaborators: Git/GitHub.  
  
One main point about integrating Git and GitHub in our architecture is the fact that you will be required to obtain some basic knowledge of the Unix shell. If you want to learn a little more about the Unix shell, here's an ebook that you can read and use to try out a little more things in your Jupyter Notebook accounts:  
  
[Learn Python the hard way - Appendix](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html)  
  
  
I recommend that you take the time to go through the above eBook. It will not take much of your time, but it will make you feel a lot more comfortable when dealing with the command line interface.  
The commands used by GitHub are very specific. Please refer to the GitHub notebook for a very brief summary of what you need to know.  
  
That's it for today, see you all tomorrow!
