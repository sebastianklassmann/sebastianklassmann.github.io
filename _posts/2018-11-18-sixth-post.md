### LSTM Networks and Music Prediction  
  

**Welcome back!**  
    
By now, we are well into a good start regarding music21 and have been  
dealing with basic object types and operations.  
  
As always, new course material can be pulled from our master branch on  
GitHub. If there is any technical difficulties regarding the access to our  
materials, don't hesitate to contact me.  
  
In the meantime, feel free to check out [**this article**](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-generate-music-using-a-lstm-neural-network-in-keras-68786834d4c5)  
to get a better idea of the possibilities offered by integrating  
music21's converter functions with the power of TensorFlow and Keras.  
  
See you all tomorrow!
