### Welcome to the GitHub page for our Summer Term 2019 course! ###

I am glad that you found this site. It will be updated in due time to contain
useful bits of information, reading material and presentations dealt with in our
course.

For now, feel free to browse older posts from last semester, as well as the
pages referenced in the "resources" section.  

See you all next Tuesday!
