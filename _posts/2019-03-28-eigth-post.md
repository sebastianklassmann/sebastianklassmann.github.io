### Welcome to the GitHub page for our Summer Term 2019 course! ###

I am glad that you found this site. It will be updated in due time to contain
useful bits of information, reading material and presentations dealt with in our
course.

For now, feel free to browse older posts from last semester, as well as the
pages referenced in the "resources" section.  

One more important thing: please head over to [https://github.com](GitHub) and  create a free account. Please write down your login credentials and pick a user name that can be identified.]

See you all next Tuesday and please remember to bring an internet-capable device(i.e., a laptop or tablet computer!)
