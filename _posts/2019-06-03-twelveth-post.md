#Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks 

Dear students,
we are off to our next step in this course.

After having dealt with music21 for some weeks now and having grasped an understanding of fundamental concepts and functions, we will now be turning to this semester's second core topic.

First of all, [here's an overview article](https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-networks-for-music-a-journey-through-its-history-91f93c3459fb) that might be a nice overview for you all regarding the musicological application of the concepts we are about to introduce over the remaining course of this semester.


Additionally, [here's](www.towardsdatascience.com) a blog that will often contain interesting posts on data science / machine learning topics that frequently deal with topics of musicological interest.


Lastly, here are some interesting projects that you might want to check out:

*[DeepJazzz](https://deepjazz.io)
*[BachBot](https://github.com/feynmanliang/bachbot/)
*[GRUV](https://github.com/MattVitelli/GRUV)

So, see you all tomorrow and let's dive right in!
